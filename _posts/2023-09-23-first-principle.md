# First Principle

It actually a way of thinking, started to well-known by Elon Musk.

It dropped me back to lots of thinking when I was in high school and some mistakes that I felt stupid for. But it's not late to discuss this, which is a good thing.

### My understanding of first principle

I am not pretty sure the origin of this term, I don't want to talk about philosophical problems here, but indeed both are so similer way of thinking. Searching for the explanation of fundamental question. While first principle reasons up from that explanation, and to solve the problem. Elon explained it through the interview in [solving the problem of EV battary](https://youtu.be/NV3sBlRgzTI?si=mgh_rwU97NArJmSV). 

If you start your thinking by not following the *assumed fact* that people commonly accepted and used, that will be a whole another story.

### What I did in high school? 

I used to do tons of *fake work*, reading materials which not relevant to school's units, making some beautiful class notes, asking some tough questions for sense of fulfillment...(that's what I was doing, Cryyyy). All of those works leading to one result, *make your feeling good and ignore the fact that you are still in the same place, that's called fake work*.

I am still making this mistake somehow, like making class note, but for reasoning process. (only for memorize the outline, for taking note advice, recommand this clip from [Jordan Peterson](https://youtu.be/lMvvdz7YJ-Q?si=lCfU6Jb73EW5ADvT).

(Just write down how you think, and repeat)

### How first pinciple fix the *fake work* ?
When you start to think about the fundamental problem in your work, you will be more clear to the reality. Like the example of what I did in high school, did a lot of fake work for avoiding the fundamental problem which you should deal with. Here I'd like to directly quote from [Ray Dalio's *Principles*](https://www.amazon.com.au/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio-ebook/dp/B071CTK28D/ref=sr_1_6?crid=BBRHYPSPXGSU&keywords=ray+dalio+principles+amazon&qid=1695473013&sprefix=ray+dalio+principles+amazon%2Caps%2C223&sr=8-6), where life principles are introduced in part 2.



> "To be hyperrealist, is to be more precisely and accurate understanding the reality. when you have your setback in life, your level of success will be depended on realizing the fact, even though it's not seem at this moment."



 Strongly recommend to read if you sort of problems like me. During back those days, I start to ask *"What is the most fundamental and important problem?"* Whether it is in the school work, or everyday life. 


 *Reailty doesn't care abou what you feel.*

 

 Casual thinking in life, hope it might help you in some ways.
